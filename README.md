# QuantumZero
The QuantumZero repository hosts the project’s public-facing static website, delivered through GitLab Pages. This site provides high-level information about the platform, including architectural overviews, user workflows, and integration guidance for external stakeholders. It serves as the central communication point for users, developers, and third-party partners, offering clear, accessible documentation separate from the system’s source code.

## Primary Contents
- Project overview and conceptual documentation
- Architecture summaries (DIDs, VCs, ZKPs, trust registry)
- User onboarding materials and FAQs
- API references and integration guides
- Visual diagrams and system walkthroughs
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript assets
- Links to mobile and server repositories

## Rationale
Separating the static site into its own repository simplifies maintenance, enables continuous updates without affecting the application codebases, and aligns with best practices for developer-facing identity platforms (e.g., Auth0, SpruceID). It also allows the team to maintain formal CSC688 documentation and public presentation resources in one centralized, easily distributable location.
