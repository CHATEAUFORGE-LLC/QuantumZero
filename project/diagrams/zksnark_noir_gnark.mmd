    Note over Bench, Report: Tooling Evaluation: Performance & Mobile Compatibility

    %% Test 1: Mobile Generation Speed
    Bench->>Mopro: runProver(circuit="range_check", input="25")
    activate Bench
    activate Mopro
    Mopro-->>Bench: proof_time_ms (e.g., 850ms)
    deactivate Mopro
    
    %% Test 2: Backend Verification Speed
    Bench->>Gnark: verifyProof(proof, public_inputs)
    activate Gnark
    Gnark-->>Bench: verify_time_ms (e.g., 12ms)
    deactivate Gnark
    
    %% Test 3: Circuit Definition Ease
    Bench->>Noir: compileCircuit(source_code)
    activate Noir
    Noir-->>Bench: constraint_count (e.g., 4000)
    deactivate Noir
    deactivate Bench

    %% Decision Logic
    Note right of Bench: Comparison Logic:<br/>1. Is Mobile Time < 1s? [NF-OP-01]<br/>2. Is Verification < 500ms? [NF-OP-02]
    
    Bench->>Report: generateMatrix(Mopro, Gnark, Noir)
